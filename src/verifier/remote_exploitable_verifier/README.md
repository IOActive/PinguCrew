# RemoteExploitableverifier #
This verifier remotely verifies crashes. It connects to a *gdbserver* instance. The architecture of the client and the server may be different, e.g. a x64 server to run `remote_exploitable_verifier.py` and a MIPS target device. The gdb plugin *exploitable* supports x86/x64, ARM and MIPS as of September 2018.
## Installation ##
Just use pip3:
``` bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Furthermore, you have to clone to this directory:

``` bash
