# Rexploitablec #
This is a small C client for *RemoteExploitableVerifier*. It receives test cases that should be verified remotely. It calls *gdbserver* and waits until *RemoteExploitableVerifier* finished its tests. Then, it calls *gdbserver* with the next test case.

## Building rexploitablec ##

Before you can build *rexploitablec*, you need to build the library [rabbitmq-c](https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c). Follow the documentation of this process.

Afterwards, you can build *rexploitablec*. Just use the `Makefile` to build it. The build process was only tested with gcc. Though, other compilers like clang should work as well. *rexploitablec* was sucessfully build for Intel (x86/x64) and MIPS (32 bit, big endian) architectures.

## Configuration ##

*rexploitablec* is configured via a simple ini-file.
